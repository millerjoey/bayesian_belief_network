Code and presentation from class. Code is general enough--you should be able to run any dataset through it and explore the data on your own with only a few modifications.

Data from caselisting.txt is a selection of 30 variables from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System of nhtsa.gov corresponding to the 2014 dataset.

Access the rest of the data and the levels of the variables which are only accessible throught he querying system (as far as I know) at:
http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov//QueryTool/QuerySection/SelectYear.aspx

1. [year 2014] submit
2. [option 3] submit
3. [see caselisting.txt for fields or] choose your own fields, submit
4. Click case listings
5. Check all fieds, submit
6. Observe levels and descriptions by clicking on variable or export dataset
